# Prague Subway Network Graph Exploration

## Context around the project

This repository is the final project of ISEP "Algorithmie et Programmation Avancée" class (CS Master's level course). The project aims to put into practice the different design patterns and the graph theory seen throughout this semester’s algorithmics course.

The group choose to work on a dataset of the Subway System of the city of Prague, Czech Republic and use Java 11 (wrapped with Maven) without any other libraries except JUnit. The goal is to model the subway network of Prague with a unweighted and weighted graph, to perform search algorithms to find the shortest paths between stations and identify clusters in the network.
